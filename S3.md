# S3

Models and files are uploaded directly to S3 during the publishing phase. These files are then used during any invocations of the system.
The files are tied to a system version, and here is the structure they have in S3:

    <bucket_name>/<user_id>/<system_id>/<req_id>/[files]

### Bucket name 
This is the root S3 bucket where files are stored in. Currently we have 1, feather-ai-dev-front-storage

### User ID
All files and systems created by a user are under their user folder. This is a GUID

### System ID
Each system has a unique ID, with each system having multiple versions. This is a GUID

### ReqID
Each publish request is assigned a unique ID. Once the publish completes, this request ID is tied to a system version.

## Examples

A real example showing a fully qualified name for a file published as **src/examples/example1.py**:

    UserID = c81ff1f6-cedb-4723-94f8-6b8a099cf700
    SystemID = 2e339351-1f23-48ab-9d72-fc6fac013198
    UploadReqID = 448fbd42-6347-4f80-83f8-4e8e21268e4c
